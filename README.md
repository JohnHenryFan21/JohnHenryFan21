👋 Hi, I’m Dashaun

I’m an active-duty U.S. Air Force Member with a strong technical foundation and a long-term career focus in cybersecurity, automation, and secure system design. I approach technology with a builder’s mindset, preferring hands on projects, real-world use cases, and systems that actually scale.

🎯 What I’m Working Toward

Transitioning into cybersecurity / security engineering roles (SOC, Blue team, DevSecOps)

Continuing service in the Air National Guard (AGR) while growing technical depth

Building a portfolio that proves skill through projects, not just certifications

Long-term goal: operate at the intersection of security, automation, and engineering leadership

🔐 Technical Focus

Cybersecurity: SOC concepts, CTFs, incident analysis, risk & governance

Automation & Dev: Python, scripting, APIs, AI workflows, no-code/low-code tooling

Systems Thinking: Networking fundamentals, Linux, containers, cloud concepts

Projects: AI-powered content tools, automations, security labs, productivity systems

I enjoy breaking complex problems into clean, repeatable systems and improving them over time.

🧠 How I Think & Work

Disciplined and goal-oriented (military mindset)

Curious, analytical, and documentation-driven

Prefer clarity over buzzwords

Build first, refine constantly

Comfortable learning fast in unfamiliar environments

📚 Education & Growth

B.S. Cybersecurity & Information Assurance (in progress)

CompTIA A+, Network+, ITF+, ITIL 4, Security+

Currently studying for CCNA

Actively building labs and tooling alongside coursework

🚀 Outside the Code

I’m also interested in fitness, personal optimization, and creative side projects and personal finance. I enjoy building systems whether that’s code, workflows, or life routines that make progress measurable and sustainable.

If you’re a recruiter or engineer looking for someone who blends discipline, curiosity, and execution, you’re in the right place.
